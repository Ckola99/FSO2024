My Full Stack Developer Oath
I acknowledge that full-stack development can be extremely challenging, but I will use every tool and strategy available to make the process smoother and more efficient.

Constant Awareness:

I will always have my browser's developer console open to monitor errors and behavior in real-time.
I will use the Network tab in the browser's dev tools to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend, verifying requests and responses.
Backend and Data Monitoring:

I will frequently check the server to confirm that the data sent from the frontend is processed and saved correctly.
I will keep an eye on the database to ensure the backend stores data in the expected format.
Progress in Small Steps:

I will approach development step-by-step, ensuring that every small feature or function works before moving on to the next.
Debugging with Console Logs:

I will write console.log statements generously to verify the flow of the code and tests, helping to pinpoint problems early.
Fix Before Adding More Code:

If the code does not work, I will refrain from adding more. Instead, I will start removing parts of the code until it works or revert to a previous working state.
Verify Functionality in Tests:

If a test fails, I will make sure the functionality works in the actual application before trying to fix the test itself.
Ask for Help Properly:

When I encounter issues, I will ask for help in a clear, concise, and well-formulated way, ensuring I include all relevant details to make it easier for others to understand the problem and provide useful answers.
